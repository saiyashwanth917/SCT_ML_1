# SCT_ML_1
In this task, we implemented a linear regression model to predict house prices based on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms using the Housing.csv dataset. We used only these two features to align with the task requirements. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and the model was trained using scikit-learn’s LinearRegression. The performance of the model was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score. Finally, the model’s coefficients and intercept were printed to interpret how each feature contributes to the final price prediction. This provides a simple yet interpretable model for estimating house prices with limited input variables.
